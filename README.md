# usda_plants

A repository for a series of Python scripts that takes data from the USDA Plants database (http://plants.usda.gov/java/) in comma delimited text file format and creates a relational database with synonymy lookup table. The final script takes a local species list with codes and titles and created a cross-reference table between the local codes and the USDA codes.
